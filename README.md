## Usage

Upon visting the RatHub website you will be prensenting with a login/signup page. In order to proceed further into application you will need to create an account and log in. 

Once you have logged in you will be presented with the opportunity to adopt your first rat - click the Adopt a Rat button! This will open the rat designer and allow you to customise the look of your rat, name it and adopt it.

After adopting your rat you will be taken back to the View My Rats page and your new rat will be visible with all of it's information. Each rat has it's own Rattributes and ChaRATeristics.

Much of the app is still under construction or in need of some polishing, but you can buy items/food, feed your rat and find it a job. 

## Future Development

Lots to talk about here!

In the very short term we are ironing out kinks and completing the functionality of the current features:

- Feeding your rat
  - Feeding your rat will require the use of an item you've bought.
  - Different foods bought in the shop will provide levels of sustenuance.

- Getting a job
  - Jobs will have requirements e.g Grand Wizard job will have a ChaRATeristic require meant of level 5.
 
- Search the Trash
  - Searching the trash once per day will provide the user with a random item

- Cemetary 
  - Rats can actually die when they are left uncared for.
  - Dead rats will appear in the graveyard

- Friends
  - Allow a user to connect with others and view their rats

Longer term:

  - Mini games
  - Rat battles
  - Rats in love
  - Happiness rating
  - More lore
  - Rat health and medicine
  - More items and grater customisation of your rats
  - Features more complex in general
